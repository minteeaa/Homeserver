### <p align="center">not really a guide, or a fully-fledged homeserver setup, but it works, and is 99% stable. and it's also my personal setup.</p>
### <p align="center">very large thanks to [zilexa](https://github.com/zilexa) and their [homeserver repo](https://github.com/zilexa/Homeserver), without it I  would not have set this up so easily. *this homeserver setup is heavily based off of the mentioned repository. if you use Arch, go check it out.*</p>

# **Info**
**this setup is not at all finished, and there will be more added to this repo as time goes on and I set up more parts of the homeserver.**

this is meant more to be a backup for the important parts in case I ever need it. any suggestions are welcome. 

## **OS**
- Debian based OS (my server uses [Ubuntu Server 22.04.1](https://ubuntu.com/download/server))
    - Using server with no DE as this is not a workstation for myself; it is simply a standalone server I can access through SSH
- BTRFS filesystem

## **Installation**
### **Installing the OS**
Install the OS of choice, in your own way or using a [bootable live environment](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview)

* Select BTRFS filesystem with **no swap**

### **Docker and other tools**
`cd` to a directory you like downloads to be in , and run the [setup script](https://github.com/minteeaa/homeserver/blob/master/initialsetup.sh)
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minteeaa/homeserver/master/initialsetup.sh
bash initialsetup.sh
```
##### installs Docker using the repository method and by [abiding to the post-install docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)

### **That can't be all, right?**
it absolutely isn't the end of this README. 

well, it is for right now.

fear not, the rest of the instruction *will be added soon.* i'm updating this repo as i build my homeserver, so it might be slow to properly document everything that needs to happen for setup.
